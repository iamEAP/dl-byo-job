  "faq_who_question": "Who are you and why are you trying to get me to move to Dals Långed?",
  "faq_who_answer": "<0>This webpage was put together by residents of Dals Långed in collaboration with [x], [y], and [z] with the explicit goal of attracting remote workers to our village.</0><1>We believe remote workers will play an important role in revitalizing and sustaining rural communities in Europe, and we believe our village in particular has everything you need in order for you to join us!</1>",
  "faq_hybrid_question": "I'm in a hybrid role where I need to be in the office from time to time. Is that possible?",
  "faq_hybrid_answer": "<0>If your office is located in Gothenburg, Karlstad, Trollhättan, or Uddevalla, then Dals Långed could be a viable option! It would come down to the specifics of your situation.</0><1>Gothenburg and Karlstad are both about 1:30 away (~30 minutes in a car, then ~1 hour by train) with good connections during commute times. Trollhättan and Uddevalla can be reached in ~1:15 by car.</1>",
  "faq_welcome_question": "I heard small Swedish villages can be unwelcoming to outsiders. Is that true in Dals Långed?",
  "faq_welcome_answer": "<0>With residents coming from at least 25 countries, Dals Långed is a diverse and welcoming environment. The continual presence of a school in town since the 1930s has led to generations of locals being accustomed to the ebb and flow of new people and new ideas in a way unique among rural villages in Sweden.</0>",
  "faq_transit_question": "How well-connected is Dals Långed? Will I need a car to survive?",
  "faq_transit_answer": "<0>You'll find all of life's essentials readily available within walking distance in town (a grocery store, postal services, simple restaurants, etc). There is a direct (if infrequent) bus connection to Åmål, from which you can get anywhere else in Sweden via the rail network.</0><1>While there are some in town who are able to live comfortably without a personal vehicle, you may find it easier and more convenient to own a car for those occasional trips out of town. If you have a license but no car, there is also a local car share program you could take advantage of.</1>",
